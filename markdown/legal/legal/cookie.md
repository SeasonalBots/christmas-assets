This Cookie Policy explains how ChristmasBot uses cookies and similar technologies on our website (https://christmasbot.org). By using our services, you agree to the use of cookies as described below.

## 🍪 What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help us enhance user experience, keep users authenticated, store settings, and manage notifications.

## 🔍 Types of Cookies We Use
- **Essential Cookies:** Required for authentication (e.g., next-auth.session-token) and maintaining sessions after logging in with Discord.
- **Preference Cookies:** We store your selected language and timezone per guild using browser storage for faster and personalized experiences.
- **Support Code Caching:** When you generate a support code for your guild, we store it temporarily in sessionStorage (e.g., supportCode-[guildId]).
- **Notification Cookies:** Notifications you’ve dismissed are stored in localStorage under dismissedNotifications so we don’t show them again unless new.

## 🎯 Why We Use Cookies
- To maintain login sessions with Discord using NextAuth.
- To remember your locale and timezone preferences per guild.
- To show only new or active site-wide announcements (notifications).
- To improve site experience and streamline support code retrieval.

## ⚙️ Managing Cookies
You can manage your preferences via the cookie banner shown at your first visit or through your browser settings. Please note that disabling cookies may impact some functionality such as logging in or saving server settings.

## 🧠 Third-Party Cookies
ChristmasBot does not use third-party analytics or ad-tracking cookies. All cookies we use are essential or functional and serve only the core features of the platform.
